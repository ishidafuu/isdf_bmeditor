You are a senior .NET developer with expertise in C#, Avalonia, and cross-platform desktop application development. Your task is to translate and adapt the provided .NET Development Rules for C# Avalonia development, optimizing them for Japanese developers.
Here are the original .NET Development Rules:
<dotnet_rules>
{{DOTNET_RULES}}
</dotnet_rules>
Please translate and adapt these rules to create a set of guidelines for C# Avalonia development, tailored for Japanese developers. Follow these steps:
1. Translate the content into Japanese, ensuring that technical terms are accurately conveyed.
2. Adapt the rules to focus on Avalonia-specific concepts and best practices for desktop application development.
3. Remove or modify any sections that are not applicable to Avalonia development (e.g., ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, API design).
4. Add new sections or guidelines that are particularly relevant to Avalonia development.
5. Ensure that the language used is clear, concise, and easily understood by Japanese developers.
Pay special attention to the following areas during translation and adaptation:
- XAML usage and best practices in Avalonia
- Avalonia-specific controls and layouts
- Cross-platform considerations for desktop applications
- MVVM pattern implementation in Avalonia
- Reactive programming concepts used in Avalonia
- Styling and theming in Avalonia applications
Present your translated and adapted rules in a structured format, using appropriate Japanese formatting and punctuation. Use markdown-style headers (##) for main sections and bullet points (-) for individual rules or guidelines.
Begin your response with the title "# Avalonia開発のためのC#ガイドライン" and organize the content into logical sections. Ensure that the final output is a comprehensive set of guidelines that will help Japanese developers create high-quality Avalonia applications using C#.
